# Annotation Cache

Annotation Cache is a resource based on [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/), and [VEP](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html).
It was created for the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) community, and has been uploaded to S3 with the help of [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and [Tower](https://tower.nf/).
All of that was made possible by [Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/).
